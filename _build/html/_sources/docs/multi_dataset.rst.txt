MultiDataset
--------------


MultiDataset is a container data structure to hold and manage multiple MLDataset instances. pyradigm also offers two "meta" data structures that can hold multiple pyradigm MLDatasets in a more convenient and efficient way. The main purpose of these containers is to automatically perform checks for compatibility of a collection of Datasets (same set of samplet IDs, targets and attributes etc) which is often necessary when performing comparisons in cross-validation.


Key uses:

    - Uniform processing individual MLDatasets e.g. querying same set of IDs
    - ensuring correspondence across multiple datasets in CV
